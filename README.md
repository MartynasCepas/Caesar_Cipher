# Caesar_Cipher

This is a simple .Net program built to quickly encrypt or decrypt text using Caesar algorithm.

## Installation 

Project was created using Visual Studio 2019 IDE, so I would suggest using it to run the project.

## Usage

After the form window has opened:
1. Select the cipher key
2. Write text into encrypt or decrypt fields
3. See the result on the right text field

The program is using standart english abc with 26 letters.
